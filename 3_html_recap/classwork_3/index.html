    <h1>Speech: "To be or not to be, that is the question"</h1>

    <br /><br />

    <em>(from</em> Hamlet, <em>spoken by Hamlet</em>) <br /><br />
    To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br />

    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />

    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />

    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br />

    And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,<br />

    No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br />

    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br />

    That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation<br />

    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep<br />

    To sleep; perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:<br />

    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br />
